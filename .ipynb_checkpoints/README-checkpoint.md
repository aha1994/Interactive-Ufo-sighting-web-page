# Javascript-Challenge-AHA
This project uses HTML/CSS, Javascript, and bootstrap in order to build a basic website that displays ufo sighting data from a static csv file. The level one site displays all of the data by default, with the ability to filter on the date. The level two site is the same as level one, but allows the user to define what parameter they are filtering on.
